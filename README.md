# About
Royal Render is the powerful application to organize your render jobs for your renderfarm. Itâ€™s more than a tool to start frames on your farm, it's an advanced application to manage, control and check your renders.Royal Render has been shaped by the harsh realities of projects small and large. 

We constantly pursue improved workflow, meaningful features and better performance.  We put ease of use up front, keeping innovative algorithms and complex architecture under the hood.
